    "final_summary": "# Waves: Full Lecture Summary\n\n## Topic Overview\n- This lecture provides an introduction to wave motion, defining waves as collective oscillations of particles. It explores the necessity of a medium for mechanical waves and distinguishes them from non-mechanical (electromagnetic) waves. The lecture also classifies mechanical waves into transverse and longitudinal types based on particle motion.\n\n## Key Concepts Covered\n- **Wave Definition:** A wave is a system of particles oscillating together, moving energy through a medium without the particles themselves traveling with the wave [0:21], [1:03].\n- **Mechanical Waves:** Require a medium (like string, air, or water) to propagate [1:39], [2:15].\n- **Non-mechanical Waves:** Can travel through a vacuum (e.g., light waves from the sun) [2:23], [2:37].\n- **Transverse Waves:** Particles oscillate **perpendicular** to the direction of wave propagation (e.g., string waves) [4:32], [4:49].\n- **Longitudinal Waves:** Particles oscillate **parallel** to the direction of wave propagation, creating compressions and rarefactions (e.g., sound waves) [5:09], [5:30].\n\n## Important Definitions & Concepts\n- **Medium Requirement:** Mechanical waves need a physical substance to move; electromagnetic waves utilize oscillating electric and magnetic fields to move through space [1:39], [2:32].\n- **Transverse Motion:** Occurs when the disturbance is up-and-down (perpendicular) while the energy moves sideways [4:38].\n- **Longitudinal Motion:** Occurs when the disturbance is in the same direction as the wave path [5:13].\n- **Compressions & Rarefactions:** Regions of high and low pressure in longitudinal waves, respectively [3:51], [4:03].\n\n## Examples Mentioned\n- **String Waves:** Moving one end of a tied string up and down creates transverse pulses [0:43], [3:36].\n- **Spring Waves:** Pulling/releasing a spring system creates longitudinal pulses [3:02], [3:51].\n- **Sound:** A mechanical, longitudinal wave that propagates through air [2:03], [5:30].\n- **Light:** A non-mechanical, electromagnetic wave that reaches Earth from the sun through a vacuum [2:32], [2:37].\n\n## Most Important for Exams\n- Remember that **particles do not move with the wave**; they only oscillate about a mean position [1:03].\n- **Mechanical waves** = Need Medium (Sound, String); **Electromagnetic** = No Medium (Light) [2:23].\n- **Transverse** = Perpendicular Oscillation; **Longitudinal** = Parallel Oscillation [5:25].\n- **Velocity of Waves:** Depends on the properties of the medium (like tension and density in a string) [0:14].",
