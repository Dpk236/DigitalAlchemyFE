    "final_summary": "# Waves: Full Lecture Summary\n\n## Topic Overview\n- This lecture provides an introduction to wave motion, defining waves as collective oscillations of particles. It explores the necessity of a medium for mechanical waves and distinguishes them from non-mechanical (electromagnetic) waves. The lecture also classifies mechanical waves into transverse and longitudinal types based on particle motion.\n\n## Key Concepts Covered\n- **Wave Definition:** A wave is a system of particles oscillating together, moving energy through a medium without the particles themselves traveling with the wave [21:07], [62:77].\n- **Mechanical Waves:** Require a medium (like string, air, or water) to propagate [98:99], [135:27].\n- **Non-mechanical Waves:** Can travel through a vacuum (e.g., light waves from the sun) [142:71], [157:25].\n- **Transverse Waves:** Particles oscillate **perpendicular** to the direction of wave propagation (e.g., string waves) [272:06], [288:64].\n- **Longitudinal Waves:** Particles oscillate **parallel** to the direction of wave propagation, creating compressions and rarefactions (e.g., sound waves) [309:2], [329:74].\n\n## Important Definitions & Concepts\n- **Medium Requirement:** Mechanical waves need a physical substance to move; electromagnetic waves utilize oscillating electric and magnetic fields to move through space [98:99], [151:55].\n- **Transverse Motion:** Occurs when the disturbance is up-and-down (perpendicular) while the energy moves sideways [277:78].\n- **Longitudinal Motion:** Occurs when the disturbance is in the same direction as the wave path [313:6].\n- **Compressions & Rarefactions:** Regions of high and low pressure in longitudinal waves, respectively [231:8], [242:96].\n\n## Examples Mentioned\n- **String Waves:** Moving one end of a tied string up and down creates transverse pulses [42:75], [216:7].\n- **Spring Waves:** Pulling/releasing a spring system creates longitudinal pulses [182:25], [231:8].\n- **Sound:** A mechanical, longitudinal wave that propagates through air [122:71], [329:74].\n- **Light:** A non-mechanical, electromagnetic wave that reaches Earth from the sun through a vacuum [151:55], [157:25].\n\n## Most Important for Exams\n- Remember that **particles do not move with the wave**; they only oscillate about a mean position [62:77].\n- **Mechanical waves** = Need Medium (Sound, String); **Electromagnetic** = No Medium (Light) [142:71].\n- **Transverse** = Perpendicular Oscillation; **Longitudinal** = Parallel Oscillation [324:88].\n- **Velocity of Waves:** Depends on the properties of the medium (like tension and density in a string) [13:71].",
