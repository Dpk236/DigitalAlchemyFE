This system is seen in arthropods, mollusks (except cephalopods), hemichordates, and tunicates [0:31].\n- **Closed Circulatory System:** Blood is pumped through a defined path of vessels (arteries, veins, and capillaries). This system is found in annelids and chordates [1:49].\n- **Advantage:** Closed systems are more advantageous as they allow for precise regulation of blood flow to tissues [1:56].",

They exhibit **single circulation** where deoxygenated blood is pumped to the gills for oxygenation and then to the body [2:26].\n- **Amphibians & Reptiles:** Most have a **three-chambered heart** (two atria, one ventricle). They exhibit **incomplete double circulation** due to the mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood in the single ventricle [3:17], [4:24].\n- **Reptilian Variation:** Most reptiles have an incomplete septum developing between the ventricles, though it remains incomplete, leading to blood mixing [4:01].",
